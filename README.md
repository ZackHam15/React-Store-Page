In this website page, I 3 main components: Footer, Navbar and Products. The products contain 8 different products with 8 IDs which are displayed on the website. These are products that are used on the Veopolis website. In the Navbar, I included a simple title with the logo beside it. I also included buttons that would direct the user to different pages on the webiste and a shopping cart where the user can see how many items are in their basket. In the Footer, I added 3 simple sections that include links to their social media, how to contact them and various other useful information. I mainly used Material UI for styling to show a different type of styling compared to the usual css.
